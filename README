NOTE: Several temporary files are created and deleted.
      So make sure you're running this in a new, clean folder.
      It's quick and dirty code. USE AT YOUR OWN PERIL.

Dependencies: 
    gnuplot with pdfcairo terminal
    bash shell (with awk and paste, which are default inclusions on all Linux systems I have used)

Running is easy: 
    ./pictureMyPain.sh

Output:
    A PDF file named rejectionIsNormal.pdf
    (I drew the labeling arrows / legend manually in Apple Keynote)

data.csv needs a VERY SPECIFIC format as follows:
    comma separated
    ProjectID, Name, IsDead?, FirstSubDate, PubDate, Reject1Date, ..., Reject6Date
    All dates should be in dd/mm/yyyy format
    If any column doesn't have data, it should have a hyphen sign -
    IsDead? is a binary field, 1 meaning the project is completely dead

    And yes, I'm fully aware how brittle this is; you do it on a Sunday morning at 7 and then we'll see ;-)

    My own data.csv is attached so you can make sure the code works as expected
